        <ul>
          <li>Macao Cold Spring</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing about the sad story of this place may give you the chills to swim into the water. But as you snorkel, you’ll be amazed at the beautiful marine life thriving under the sea. Seeing beautiful sea creatures will even put all your fears away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you wish to explore this place, low tide in the afternoon makes it the best time to snorkel at the Sunken Cemetery.
        </p>

          Mt. Hibok-hibok is a famous hiking destination for most trekkers and mountain climbers in the country. But first, you have to obtain a permit from the DENR office before you can go hiking on this volcano. Tour agencies around Mambajao can assist and sort it out for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching the summit can put you in a challenge, but the scenic views of Camiguin island can relieve tiredness. You can take a dip in hot and cold springs to soothe those tired and aching muscles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every part of the Philippines has special delicacies that are usually bought as homecoming gifts. Camiguin has its own must-try foods if you ever set foot on this island.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pastel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Vjandep Pastel is neither an art medium nor a meat-filled pastry from the Latin Americas. It’s a soft bun with sweet fillings. Originally commercialized in custard “yema” filling, but now you can try assorted flavors such as strawberry, jackfruit, cheese, chocolate, pineapple, and purple yam. You can eat it alone or pair it with your favorite drink or coffee.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Kiping</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Around the ports or tourists destinations, you can find vendors carrying plastic containers selling Camiguin’s famous street food known as “Kiping.” This delicacy is made of sun-dried cassava paste, which is fried and lightly squeezed with caramelized coconut cream.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fried Dried Squid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This delicacy is similar to the Japanese snack “Surume.” Unlike other dried squid products in Mindanao, Camiguin’s dried squid has its own distinct taste that’s sought-after by locals and tourists. It’s a flattened sun-dried whole squid that is lightly fried to make it crispy. People usually dip it in spiced vinegar before eating.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lanzones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This sweet Asian fruit also called “Longkong” or “Langsat” is a must-try, especially from September to November. Every October, Camiguin holds its annual “Lanzones Festival” in celebration for the harvest season of Lanzones. This fruit grows well in this island, thanks to the richly cultivated soil in the province.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Surol</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Surol is a signature soup dish in Camiguin that’s made up of chicken, coconut milk, and oregano. This signature dish isn’t typically made or bought as a homecoming gift, but it’s a must-try food in Camiguin.
